## About

This is a json parser that parse your input file and renders on the frontend tried to use some performance tools and practices to parse big files in shorter time. And also there is a filter to create selectors and rerender some parts of the tree according to search criteria. While rerendering whole tree according to the search criteria we need to use a map data structure to create the best impact, plan to add that soon.
